                <p>I haven't decided whether I want to focus on frontend or backend yet, but I'm open to learning both. My goal is to gain experience in both fields, work on projects, and eventually find the area that suits me best. Right now, I'm focused on improving my coding skills, understanding how websites function, and building real-world projects</p>
